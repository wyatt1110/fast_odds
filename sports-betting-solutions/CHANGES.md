# Project Organization Improvements

This document summarizes the organizational improvements made to streamline the project structure and documentation.

## üìù Documentation Improvements

1. **Consolidated Documentation Files**
   - Merged multiple documentation files into 3 core files:
     - `README.md` - Overview, structure, getting started
     - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed technical architecture
     - `UI-WORKFLOW.md` - Practical development workflow guide
   - Deleted redundant files:
     - `README-structure.md`
     - `project-map.md`
     - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` 

2. **Clearer Structure Documentation**
   - Added visual directory structure diagrams
   - Clearly labeled which directories to edit and which to avoid
   - Added emoji markers for enhanced readability
   - Standardized file and component naming conventions

3. **Improved Component Role Documentation**
   - Clear explanation of each component's purpose
   - Quick reference tables for finding files to edit
   - Simplified troubleshooting steps

## üèóÔ∏è Code Organization Improvements

1. **Component Migration Strategy**
   - Legacy components in `/src/components/` now forward to new components in `/src/frontend-ui/`
   - Example: `BetForm.tsx` now serves as a migration wrapper around `bet-entry-form.tsx`
   - This preserves backwards compatibility while moving to the new structure

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Route files (`/src/app/**`) only handle routing and layout
   - UI components (`/src/frontend-ui/**`) contain all the UI logic
   - API interfaces (`/src/lib/**`) contain service code

3. **Standardized File Naming**
   - Page components: `name-page.tsx`
   - Component files: `component-name.tsx`
   - Consistent usage of kebab-case for files, PascalCase for exports

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration of Legacy Components**
   - Continue moving components from `/src/components/` to `/src/frontend-ui/` 
   - Eventually remove the legacy components directory

2. **Standardize Import Paths**
   - Convert all relative imports to use path aliases (`@/`)
   - Update any circular dependencies

3. **Documentation Comments**
   - Add standardized header documentation to all components
   - Include purpose, usage, and file relationships

4. **Component Visualization**
   - Consider adding a visual component map to help navigate the codebase
