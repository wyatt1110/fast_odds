# OV Signals Results Updater

This script updates the results for value bets stored in the `ov_signals` table by matching them with race results from the `master_results` table.

## Overview

The OV Signals Results Updater processes incomplete betting entries and fills in their results based on actual race outcomes. It handles win/loss calculations, returns, profit/loss, starting prices, and BSP (Betfair Starting Price) data.

## How It Works

### 1. Identifies Incomplete Entries
The script searches for entries in the `ov_signals` table where:
- `result` field is 'pending' OR
- `bsp` field is null

### 2. Matches with Master Results
For each incomplete entry, it finds the corresponding race result in the `master_results` table using:
- `horse_id` - Unique identifier for the horse
- `race_id` - Unique identifier for the race

### 3. Updates Results
The script updates the following fields in `ov_signals`:

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `result` | Calculated | 'won', 'loss', or 'void' |
| `finish_position` | `master_results.position` | Horse's finishing position |
| `returns` | Calculated | Stake Ã— odds (if won), stake (if void), 0 (if loss) |
| `profit_loss` | Calculated | Returns - stake |
| `sp` | `master_results.sp_dec` | Starting Price (decimal) |
| `bsp` | `master_results.bsp` | Betfair Starting Price |

## Result Determination Logic

### Won
- Horse finished in 1st position (`position = '1'`)
- Returns = stake Ã— odds
- Profit/Loss = returns - stake

### Loss
- Horse finished in any position other than 1st
- Includes special positions like 'PU' (Pulled Up), 'UR' (Unseated Rider)
- Returns = 0
- Profit/Loss = -stake

### Void
- Race was abandoned (`is_abandoned = true`)
- Horse was a non-runner (horse name appears in `non_runners` field)
- Returns = stake (money back)
- Profit/Loss = 0

## Special Handling

### Abandoned Races
If `is_abandoned` is true in the master results, all bets for that race are voided.

### Non-Runners
The script checks if the horse name appears anywhere in the `non_runners` field. If found, the bet is voided.

### Incomplete Data
If a master result is missing BSP data, the script will:
1. Update all available fields
2. Leave BSP as null
3. Process the entry again in the next run when BSP data becomes available

## Schedule

The script runs automatically via GitHub Actions:
- **8:00 AM UTC** (9:00 AM BST / 8:00 AM GMT)
- **8:00 PM UTC** (9:00 PM BST / 8:00 PM GMT)

Can also be triggered manually through the GitHub Actions interface.

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
